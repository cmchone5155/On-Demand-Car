**Team Project - D.1 Inception
Group 4: OnDemand Car**

**1. Introduction**
        
    The project "OnDemand Car" is based around the same premise as AirBnb with the major difference being that it is about being able to rent out personal vehicles peer-to-peer. The main problem this software aims to solve is allowing individuals the opportunity for passive income just as they would with a vacant house for renting. It isn't necessarily solving a major issue, but more of allowing consumers the opportunity to rent out their cars for side money as well as rent other people's cars for convenience. By having this option, this software will allow consumers to also avoid expensive rental fees from major car rental companies.
    
**2. Initial Value Proposition and Consumer Segments**
    
    The initial value proposition for OnDemand Car is that it will help solve the problem of the lack of the current ability to rent out a personal vehicle for personal profit in a peer-to-peer platform. OnDemand Car will provide an accesible service to anyone with a vehicle or the desire to rent a vehicle from someone else in their area in an efficient, easy to use, and affordable manner. Some key features that give our service value is the ability to choose dates in which to black out for nonrental use or choose dates for rental use, as well as providing customers with payout options, and also providing a reimbursement fee to transport individuals to and from the destination of the vehicle through a ridesharing company such as Uber. The target customer for this software is individuals over the age of 18 who may be out of town frequently leaving their car unused for periods of time. This would include the demographic of any individual that owns a vehicle, any individual who might need to make passive income to pay off car payments or any other bills, any individual who has multiple vehicles that don't get used as frequently, and/or any individual who needs to rent a vehicle in the area.
