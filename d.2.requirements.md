# 1) Value Proposition 
##### Problem Statement:
“I have an extra car that just sits in my garage losing value.”
“Every time I want to go out while traveling I have to find and wait on a ride, making my vacation feel like I’m waiting more than exploring.”
“I need a truck to move this sofa but all I have access to is a mini cooper.”

##### Product Position Statement:
“For people with an extra or unused car or people traveling, onDemand car is a simple to use website that allows you to rent out or rent a vehicle making money for the former and easing the experience of travel for the latter. Unlike ride share apps you are renting the vehicle from the owner and thus driving it when you want, and if you are renting you are getting passive income from a vehicle that is otherwise unused.”

##### Value Proposition:
onDemand car is a vehicle renting website that allows users to rent other user’s vehicles so they have access to a vehicle where they would otherwise not and those renting out their vehicles make money in return.

##### Consumer Segment:
People looking for vehicles to perform tasks their own vehicle can not do.
People traveling looking for a vehicle they can drive.
People with an extra or vacant car to make extra money.

# 5) MVP:
Our MVP will be a simple website that allows users to submit a vehicle to rent, its area of service and basic car information. It will also display a list of all cars available to rent currently. Once a user enters a vehicle's information it will then be converted into a data type compatible with our database(either a list or a dictionary entry),  which can be pulled again to display on the website. As far as the website, we will just need some simple html and css to form buttons and areas where users can submit data. As well as some javascript to pull and push data to the server. This will not be secure and not protect us from SQL injection attacks but it will provide the basic essentials to show to a user.
