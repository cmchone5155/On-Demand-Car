**Team Project - D.1 Inception
Group 4: OnDemand Car**

**1. Introduction**
        
    The project "OnDemand Car" is based around the same premise as AirBnb with the major difference being that it is about being able to rent out personal vehicles peer-to-peer on a two-sided website platform. The main problem this software aims to solve is allowing individuals the opportunity for passive income just as they would with a vacant house for renting. It isn't necessarily solving a major issue, but more of allowing consumers the opportunity to rent out their cars for side money as well as rent other people's cars for convenience. By having this option, this software will allow consumers to also avoid expensive rental fees from major car rental companies and allow consumers to find the perfect car for any occasion within their specified budget.
    
**2. Initial Value Proposition and Consumer Segments**

   **Initial Value Proposition Guess:** OnDemand Car is a community-based car rental service for peer-to-peer convenience. 
   
   **Initial Consumer Segment Guess:** The initial guess for the consumer segment of OnDemand Car is individuals in the age range of 24-50 who may be out of town frequently, leaving their car unused for periods of time. This would include the demographic of any individual that owns a vehicle, any individual who might need to make passive income to pay off car payments or any other bills, any individual who has multiple vehicles that don't get used as frequently, and/or any individual who needs to rent a vehicle in the area while visiting a local town.

  **Final Consumer Segment:** The consumer segment of OnDemand Car is mainly individuals who are out of town frequently or who often leave their car unused for other various reasons. The demographic of this would include individuals in the age range of 24-50 who might need to make passive income to pay off bills. As far as who would be renting out cars from OnDemand Car, there would be three main groups.
