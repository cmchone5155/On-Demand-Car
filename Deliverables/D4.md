# 1. Introduction
OnDemand car is a vehicle renting website that allows users to rent other users’ vehicles so they have access to a vehicle where they would otherwise not and those renting out their vehicles make money in return. As such, users will have to be able to find the website, and depending on their needs either post a car to be rented out to other users or choose from a selection of cars already uploaded to the site.\

# 3. Tests
This code below uses automated testing to verify that when a user wants to submit their vehicle to the database they can do so and its correct and accurate information ( line 22-27) upon a failed addition to the database the error message below is displayed. It also utilizes automated testing in relation to connecting to the database upon a failed connection it prints out the error message below ( line 12-14) upon a successful connection it displays the message on line 15.

# 4. Adopted Technologies
PHP, XAMPP and SQL. These tools make communication between front and back end extremely easy.
# 5. Learning/Training
I, Hunter Woodruff, mostly had to touch up on my Html and CSS skills, the bare bones. To get a basic website that would flow from one page to another.

I, Austin Malmin, had to learn how to use PHP as well as how to connect SQL databases to my PHP.

I, Wesley Blair, learned how to display data from SQL databases in an HTML table with a PHP file.

I, Sami Tanquary, had to learn how to use Markdown and various styling languages to create an aesthetically pleasing readMe, license, contributing, and code of conduct file.

I, Scott Austin, had to touch up on my PHP and HTML skills so I could work with our website and database.
# 6. Deployment
As some of our group members were enrolled in CS212 which requires a hosting service we are using their current service that they have already purchased. The service we will be using is called hostwinds.\
[Hostwinds](https://www.hostwinds.com/)
# 7. Licensing
We chose to go with the MIT License as our software will need to change and modify to cover a wide variety of tasks such as taking payments, taking in private user information, controlling the movement of user’s personal vehicles and much more. This license allows us such flexibility while keeping it closed and private to protect user information.\

# 9. Look & Feel
At the moment we are going for a very bare bones approach to the UI as we focused on the backend for this assignment. As we begin to approach the end of this project, we will develop a more 2 sided interface with clear separation from the Rentee interface from the Renter interface. This was partly implemented in this deliverable by the homepage having 2 distinct different ways to navigate the website.
# 10. Lessons Learned
If I, Hunter Woodruff, had started to prepare sooner on touching up my skills with HTML and CSS I could have made a much nicer-looking website. As well as allotting myself more time to work on it though that is difficult with my current course load.

With the knowledge of what I, Austin Malmin, know now and the research I have done, If i ever need to complete this assignment again in the future it will not take me much time.

I, Wesley Blair, believe that we could have benefited from starting this assignment earlier mostly just to have more time to touch up on the finer details of the website.

I, Sami Tanquary, learned that during the first release, we should have spent more time on making the program more pleasing to look at, therefore in the second release it is expected that the site will be cleaned up.

I, Scott Austin, have learned that staying on track is super important for this project. Going forward as a team we need to prioritize staying on track.
