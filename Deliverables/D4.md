# 1. Introduction
OnDemand car is a vehicle renting website that allows users to rent other usersâ€™ vehicles so they have access to a vehicle where they would otherwise not and those renting out their vehicles make money in return. As such, users will have to be able to find the website, and depending on their needs either post a car to be rented out to other users or choose from a selection of cars already uploaded to the site.\
