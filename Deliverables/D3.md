# 1) System Description
For people with an extra or unused car or people traveling, onDemand car is a simple to use
website that allows you to rent out or rent a vehicle. Making money for the former and easing the
experience of travel for the latter. Unlike ride share apps you are renting the vehicle from the owner
and thus driving it when you want, and if you are renting you are getting passive income from a
vehicle that is otherwise unused.

There are a handful of systems required within the Ondemand car website. The almost all
encompassing one being the **Profile** system, which uses the personâ€™s *name, e=mail address, Phone
number, and social security number*. These four items, along with a few specific ones, allow anyone
to become either a **renter**, or **rentee**. A **renter** is anyone on the website listing their vehicle, they are
required to give the cars *registration* and *insurance*, as well as the routing information to their bank
so they can get paid. A **Rentee** is anyone renting a vehicle, as such they must provide a form of
payment, such as their *bank*, as well as their *drivers license*. Both parties have a part to play in the
**Payment Service**. The banking information is used in the case of the **rentee** to get their card
information, their legal first and last name. For the renter side the system will ensure they are *paid at
the end of the pay period*, to ensure payment is done on time the system will also have a built in
*confirm and receipt system*. The last thing under the profiles umbrella is the rating system, both
**renters** and **rentees** would be subject to this system. Within this system users will find a *rating* in
the form of stars, as well as a *description* of the rating.

The **renter** will also have to upload vehicle information such as, *color, mileage, and most
recent maintenance*. As well as fill out what category their vehicle would fit into. This is done by
submitting their vehicle's *make, model, year, and vehicle type*, such as SUV, truck and so on.
Renters will then be prompted to file out the availability of their vehicle, this requires a *start and
end date*. By taking everything involved with the **renter** a **listing** will be created, within the **listing**
there will be the **_renters profile_**, **_vehicle_**, **_availability_**, and *cost* of renting the **vehicle** for that time.
Last is the **communication** system which would take *messages* from both the **renter** and **rentee**
and display them to both.
