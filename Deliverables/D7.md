# 1. Introduction
The OnDemand Car system is a system built on front end HTML and CSS with back end PHP utilizing PHP admin and SQL for the database structure. It is hosted on a web server to reach the most people possible. Our ethos for the look of the front end is that it is easy to use and navigate while providing adequate information without unnecessary clicks. For our back end we just want a fast, well optimised database so users are able to pull any additional information with ease without having to wait. This will be done by allowing users to sign into profiles created on the site. There they can see their vehicles' rating as well as modify any personal info. It also provides a way for users to upload information about the cars they will be renting out to other users, and for those other users to be able to see and make informed decisions based on the uploaded information about the vehicles they can choose from. As far as payment services, that will be done by a third party system that is secure and trustworthy so user information will not be in danger\
