# 1. Description
The OnDemand Car system is a system built on front end HTML and CSS with back end PHP. It is hosted on a web server to reach the most people possible. Our ethos for the look of the front end is that it is easy to use and navigate while providing adequate information without unnecessary clicks. For our back end we just want a fast, well optimised database so users are able to pull any additional information with ease without having to wait. This will be done by allowing users to sign into profiles created on the site. Ways for users to upload information about the cars they will be renting out to other users, and for those other users to be able to see and make informed decisions based on the uploaded information about the vehicles they can choose from.

We used a version of the three layer architecture to build our program. The 3 layers that we used are the HTML interface, PHP to connect to the database, and an SQL database. This architecture is best for our design because it is the most efficient way for our system to operate and communicate with each other.
