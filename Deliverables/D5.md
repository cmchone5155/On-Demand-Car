# 1. Description
The OnDemand Car system is a system built on front end HTML and CSS with back end PHP. It is hosted on a web server to reach the most people possible. Our ethos for the look of the front end is that it is easy to use and navigate while providing adequate information without unnecessary clicks. For our back end we just want a fast, well optimised database so users are able to pull any additional information with ease without having to wait. This will be done by allowing users to sign into profiles created on the site. Ways for users to upload information about the cars they will be renting out to other users, and for those other users to be able to see and make informed decisions based on the uploaded information about the vehicles they can choose from.
# 2. Architecture

We used a version of the three layer architecture to build our program. The 3 layers that we used are the HTML interface, PHP to connect to the database, and an SQL database. This architecture is best for our design because it is the most efficient way for our system to operate and communicate with each other.

### Use Case Description
#### Brief description
* A Renter is inputting a new vehicle into the database
#### Actor Brief
* Renter uploads new vehicle information
#### Preconditions
* Renter already has an account
#### Basic flow of events
* Renter lands on homepage
* Renter clicks sign in
* Renter redirected to sign in page
* Renter enters Credentials
* Renter goes to renters page
* Renter submits necessary information about vehicle
* New Vehicle added to database
#### Alternative flow
* N/A
#### Post condition
* New Vehicle added to database

# 5. Design Patterns
Design Pattern 1: (Creational) Singleton - [Link](https://github.com/cmchone5155/On-Demand-Car/blob/main/386_web/databasePHP/connect-sql.php) creates a connection to the database

# 6. Design Principles
* S - each of our classes are designed with one specific purpose in mind. For example, our vehicle class's only purpose is to hold information about a vehicle which will be displayed. Similarly, the renter and rentee class both contain information relative to the renter and the rentee.

* O - To make sure our program is ready for future extensions but also not open to being modified by unauthorized users,  we will implement public and private methods and data to ensure that this philosophy holds true

* L - in order for the objects in our program to be replaceable with instances of their subtypes and still maintain correctness in our program we will use polymorphism on the vehicle types to maintain the substitution principle as well as in other areas of the program like userâ€™s instances of renter and rentee.

* I - like classes, interfaces should also have a specific purposes, to ensure this is upheld in our code we have segregated the interfaces for renters and rentees; However, users are directed to a landing home page for our company when they first enter the site and then can enter the direct channels they need. This interface provides only interfaces that the client will need.

* D - As high level modules should not depend on lower level modules, our software has upheld this principle. We have our data base system and sql that pulls vehicle and user info not be affecting out interface classes nor our java code.
